Intelligent Hearing


1. The project aims to find the intuition of some mechanical sound is faulty by using a sound classification approach. 
2. From google's urban sound 8K AC and Car Horn are selected, for test purposes the smartphone audio recording of an AC and car horn is acquired.
3. The project carries out basic signal processing and sound classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Anomaly detection approaches.
4. The project aims at researching for an algorithm that would hear any noise and tell something is wrong if something is wrong like a human would make a decision on hearing a faulty noise irrespective of the training
